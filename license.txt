                  Reservation of Rights Agreement

This Reservation of Rights Agreement (the 'Agreement') is made by and among
[Enterprise Holdings Inc.] its subsidiaries, divisions, affiliates, successors,
and assignees, and those acting under its permission and on its authority
(hereafter 'Enterprise') and you in connection with the software and/or
associated object or source code distributed with this Agreement and referenced
in the associated contracts or agreements governing the relationship between
you and Enterprise (the 'Software').

By accessing Enterprise's Software, you agree to the terms of this Agreement.
This Agreement is meant to complement the contracts and/or agreements you may
have entered into defining and governing your relationship with Enterprise and
any access to, or use of, the Software (the 'Contracts').  This Agreement does
not convey any rights in or to the Software.  Unless specifically granted in
the Contracts, you have no right to modify, distribute or create derivative
works based upon the Software.  The terms of this Agreement are subject to the
terms of the Contracts and any inconsistency between these terms and those of
the Contracts shall be governed by the language of the Contracts.

Enterprise is the owner of all rights, title, and interest in and to the
Software, including, but not limited to, any and all copyrights associated
with the Software.  Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Contracts,
Enterprise has granted to you rights to or in the Software (the 'Rights')
in order to perform under the Contracts.  You agree not to remove or alter
any copyright notices provided in or with the Software and you agree not to
remove or alter any reference, access or link to this Agreement.

The Software may be distributed or bundled with other third-party software.
You acknowledge and agree that your right to use, access, or interact with any
such third-party software is governed exclusively by the terms and conditions
of any licenses, agreements or contracts from those third parties accompanying
any such third-party software when distributed to you.  Any such third-party
contracts shall govern and control your use, access, or interaction with any
third-party software in connection with the performance of your duties under
the Contracts or this Agreement.

Your rights in and to the Software are limited to those Rights specified in
the Contracts and you  acknowledge that you have received only those Rights in
the Software specified in the Contracts and that all rights in or to the
Software not specifically granted to you in the Contracts remain entirely
with Enterprise.  Unless expressly granted in the Contracts, you acknowledge
that you receive no rights of ownership in or to the Software through your
use, access, or interaction with that Software.

You further acknowledge that your Rights in and to the Software are entirely
dependent upon your compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the
Contracts.  You agree that your failure to comply with any of the terms and
conditions of the Contracts will result in the immediate termination of any
Rights you may have received by way of the Contracts and any continued
exercise of the Rights after such termination will be considered
an infringement of Enterprise's rights in and to the Software
and will be dealt with accordingly.
